# jpa-postgres Project
====================

This project uses Camel CXF REST API and Active MQ. It gets input as POST request and stores it into Postgres DB using JPA.
This project is created to run as a web archive on JBoss EAP server.

It contains all the configurations required to use following components:
* Camel CXF REST API

* configuration using Spring XML schema
* CamelSpringTestSupport Unit testing framework

When a message is posted to REST API, it is also sent to an Active MQ topic.
